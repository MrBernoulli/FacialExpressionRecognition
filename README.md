# FacialExpressionRecognition

In this project, we train a Convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize seven facial expressions: surprise, happiness, anger, digust, fear, neutral, and sad.
The images are 48 x 48 grayscale, and 28708 of them were used for training, while 7178 were kept for validation.
